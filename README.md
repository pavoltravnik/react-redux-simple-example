[complex graph of data flow in Redux](https://build-3200vr7un.now.sh/React_Redux.html)

This is one of the most super simple examples of React and Redux you can find on internet. This is just the most simple example just for brief explanation of data flow. Don't use Redux. 

If you are interested into managing state in React use [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) instead. It is much easier to understand and use. [Super simple example of Context API](https://github.com/pavoltravnik/react-context-supersimple) is also available on github.

**To run this app:**

```
npm i

npm start
```

## Demo
If you are looking for example, you can try this super light app here [demo](https://build-3200vr7un.now.sh/). It consists of one button and one text field.
